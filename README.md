# Library-Robot

Summer workshop with Kirklees Library in 2019. 

We added 20+ robots to the #PounderArmy

The spreadsheet contains costings on an assumption of 30 kits being required. These prices are correct as of August 2019

If you build any then a tweet to @heeedt and @biglesp with the hashtag #PounderArmy will be great :)

Have fun!
